Hello Internet My name is Ted and I make iPhone apps I have spent over five years building and selling my own iOS apps and apps for clients I get passive income from my apps each month I also teach iOS development to local high school and college kids Not too long ago I came across a book that taught me a lot about programming It was a book on Test Driven Development for iOS Unfortunately its a little outdated and there are so many new tools available that I wanted to create my own course I have already started on it writing popular articles and blog posts on unit testing for iOS You check out a few of them here How to get started with iOS Unit Tests in Swift What should we unit test in our iOS apps How to write unit tests in Swift without making everything public How not to convince your boss to let you write unit tests Have you ever needed to test things that are kind of hard to trigger like an event that happens when a player wins 1000 games Or maybe a button that needs to turn green next Wednesday for some reason Want to know how the pros do it Unit testing is the answer With unit tests you can simulate next Wednesday so you can test that your app does the right thing You can pretend your player has won 1000 games so you can test that your app delivers the correct reward And thats just the surface Unit tests can save you a ton of time when it comes to the longterm maintenance of your code Youve probably seen unit testing on job descriptions wondered how you can learn it and what it takes to do an app in that test driven style I will show you all of those things and more Youll even learn some of the newer concepts like protocol oriented programming and how it relates to unit testing We will do everything in the newest version of Apple’s programming language Swift 4 using the latest tools like Xcode 9 and iOS 11 We will start with the basics and then move on to build an entire app testfirst using the principles of test driven development If you have ever wanted to improve your skills as a programmer save tons of development time and remove the guess work out of testing this course is for you Even if you aren’t all that technical and you want to be a better project manager you’ll learn a ton about what it takes to make an app that launches with very few bugs in production When you pledge your support you will get full access to the course at a steep discount It’s my way of thanking you for getting this project off the ground I’ve got a few other rewards lined up for the higher tiers so please go ahead and take a look at those Thanks for your support and I look forward to creating the best course on iOS unit testing you’ve ever seen
