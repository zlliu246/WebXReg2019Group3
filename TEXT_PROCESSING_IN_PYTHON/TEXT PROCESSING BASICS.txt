Using python: nltk 

Requirements:
    python 3.7
    type "pip install nltk, pandas" into terminal


1. Lowercase
    - change everything to lowercase

2. Remove punctuation 
    - remove all punctuation 
    - "from string import punctuation"

3. Tokenize
    - turn a paragraph (type string) into a list containing many strings
    - so easier for your comp to process

    EG.
        Before tokenization: "i like to drink apple juice" 
        After tokenization:  ["i", "like", "to", "drink", "apple", "juice" ]

4. Remove stopwords
    - stopwords: common words like "he", "i", "on" etc.
    - that do not add much value to word analytics cus they're everywhere
    - remove them from your list of words

    hint: 
        from nltk.corpus import stopwords
        stopwords = stopwords.words("english")
        stopwords = set(stopwords)      # to make this faster

5. stemming
    - changes a word to its root form

    eg. 
        dogs --> dog
        swimming --> swim
        fantastically --> fantast
        building --> build
        events --> event

    if word has not root form, the function returns itself


TARGET:
    new csv file, with the relevant text cleaned
