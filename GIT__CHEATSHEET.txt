Git cheatsheet

I have nothing now and want a online git repository on my computer
	- go to github
	- copy paste the url (that says clone by https)
	- go to your terminal and navigate to wherever you want your folder to be
	- git clone {pasted_git_url}
	- done

I want to see wth is going on now on my local repo
	- git status

I want the most updated changes
	- git pull

I have new stuff i want to push/upload to the cloud
	- git add .
	- git commit -m "insert commit message here - can be anything but try to make it meaningful lol"
	- git push

	** NOTE: u need to git pull before you can git push **

I want to see the previous commit messages
	- git log --oneline

there a MERGE CONFLICT when i git pull. wtf do i do?
	** conflicts happen if someone else's change and your changes on the same file are different and git doesnt know which to keep **	

	- git add . (this makes git track your files)
	- git stash (this takes all new changes and saves it, then resets git to the last commit - basically put your changes somewhere temporarily)
	- git pull  (this should work)

I made weird changes that i want to get rid of. what do i do?
	- git log --oneline
	- copy paste the commit hash (around 6 letters/numbers of gibberish) you want to go back to
	
	if you dont want your changes at all:
		- git reset --hard {commit-hash}
		- "--hard" keyword gets rid of your changes completely
	
	else:
		- git reset --soft {commit-hash}
		- "--soft" keyword gets rid of your committed changes, but doesnt get rid of your changes in your code editor
